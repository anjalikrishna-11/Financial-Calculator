# Financial-Calculator
This project is a simple financial calculator that allows users to perform three types of financial calculations:
- Interest Rate Calculation
- Loan Payment Calculation
- Investment Return Calculation
Each calculation type is encapsulated in its own ES6 module to promote modularity and maintainability. The main module imports these functions and provides a user interface for performing the calculations.
